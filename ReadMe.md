html front end and then C# backend - using the Razor syntax on the top of the html file to embed logic and also reach out to the backend to process the data. this doesn't do a lot functionally but just shows how we could use this.

I set up the html front end, as well as a Ticket object and a file named Backend to demonstrate how we can pass objects around and do things with them.

Connection to a database would likely be done in "Backend" or in a file similar to it. 

I've never used Razor before, but it was recommended to me by someone because it's fairly easy to pick up and drops the need for any javascript at all.
